# Animal Shogi AI

## Overview

Welcome to the Animal Shogi AI project! This endeavor aims at developing a sophisticated AI model trained through reinforcement learning to play the game of Animal Shogi, also known as Dobutsu Shogi or Let's Catch the Lion! If you are unfamiliar with this variant of shogi, it is a simpler and more accessible version of the traditional Japanese board game, shogi, designed specifically for children and beginners.

Through this project, we intend to not only bring this delightful game into the digital realm but also elevate the playing experience with an AI opponent that can provide a challenging and enjoyable game for players of all levels.

## Features

Our AI model will incorporate the following essential features:

1. **Board Reading Mechanism**: Will be able to accurately represent the game's state at any given time.
2. **Game Rules**: To ensure a fair game, all the rules of Animal Shogi will be meticulously implemented.
3. **Win/Loss Determination**: The model will be able to determine the end game conditions accurately.
4. **Reward Function**: For reinforcement learning, a reward function will be defined to train the AI model effectively.

Moreover, the project will feature a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Python, offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

## Development

### Phase 1: Pre-Reinforcement Learning

Before we dive into reinforcement learning, we will focus on establishing the following foundations:

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Developing an interface where players can interact with the game visually.
2. **Piece Movement**: Implementing the mechanism to move the pieces according to the rules of the game.
3. **Player Turns**: Establishing a system to manage player turns effectively.
4. **Win/Loss Determination**: Creating a system to accurately determine the winning or losing conditions.

### Phase 2: Reinforcement Learning

Once the foundations are laid, we will proceed with the reinforcement learning phase to develop the AI model.

### Technologies

- **Python**: The backend and the AI model will be developed using Python to leverage its rich ecosystem of libraries and tools available for AI and machine learning.
- **GUI Libraries**: Depending on the development process, we will choose between libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, PySide, Kivy, or Pygame for the GUI development.
